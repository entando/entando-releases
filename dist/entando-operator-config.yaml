# For slow environments with low bandwidth, you can given the various pods more time to get to ready state and/or completion state by
# increasing the values for the following two properties
  entando.pod.completion.timeout.seconds: "600"
  entando.pod.readiness.timeout.seconds: "600"

# if you want to specify an additional image pull secret for the Entando operator to use, add the dockercfg json  in the
# sample-secrets/sample-pull-secret.yaml file, create the secret in  [your-sandbox-namespace]
# and uncomment the property 'entando.k8s.operator.image.pull.secrets'
#
#  entando.k8s.operator.image.pull.secrets=sample-pull-secret

# if you want to load the Entando containers from a private registry, specify the hostname using the
# property 'entando.docker.registry.override'. This is often used in conjunction with the property 'entando.k8s.operator.image.pull.secrets'
#
#  entando.docker.registry.override: "docker.io"

# if you want to retain all storage that was allocated even when the Entando custom resource it was provided for is
# deleted, then set the 'entando.k8s.operator.disable.pvc.garbage.collection' property to "true"
#  entando.k8s.operator.disable.pvc.garbage.collection: "true"

# if you want to expose all your services over TLS, specify the certificate and key in the sample-secrets/sample-tls-secret.yaml
# file, create the secret in  [your-sandbox-namespace]  and uncomment the property 'entando.tls.secret.name'
#
#  entando.tls.secret.name: sample-tls-secret

# if you want to access services with self signed certificate, or if your own TLS certificate was self signed, specify the certificate(s)
# in the  sample-secrets/sample-ca-cert-secret.yaml file, create the secret in  [your-sandbox-namespace]
# and uncomment the property 'entando.ca.secret.name'
#  entando.ca.secret.name: sample-ca-cert-secret


# if you want to specify a global routing suffix, set the value of the 'entando.default.routing.suffix' property to a
# domain suffix that will resolve to your cluster host. For Entando custom resource that do not specify an ingress
# hostname, the hostnames for deployments will be calculated by prefixing the name and namespace of the resource to this
# routing suffix.
#
#  entando.default.routing.suffix: your.domain.com

# if you want to inspect the Entando deployer pods even after deployment has completed successfully, you can turn of
# the deployer pod garbage collection by setting the property 'entando.k8s.operator.gc.controller.pods' to "false"
#
  entando.k8s.operator.gc.controller.pods: "true"

# if you want to regain access to you shared database without having to recreated schemas, but you also want to
# delete the Entando custom resources at will, you will need to  instruct the Entando operator to force a password
# reset by setting the 'entando.k8s.operator.force.db.password.reset' property to "true"
