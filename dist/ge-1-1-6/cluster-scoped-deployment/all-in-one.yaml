                    In 'STRICT' mode, the Entando Plugin Sidecar will not be deployed in
                    this EntandoPlugin microservice Pod. Secrets will be statically mounted in the EntandoPlugin microservice
                    container, and will be accessed as files.

                    In 'LENIENT' mode, the Entando Plugin Sidecar will be deployed, and it will be used to setup
                    Secrets that are used to connect to external services. This requires read/write access to Secrets
                    in the same namespace as the EntandPlugin microservice.
